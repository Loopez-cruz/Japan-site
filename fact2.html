        <p>Japanâ€™s first emperor, Jimmu, is reportedly the founder of this country.
             Japan came into existence in 660 B.C. 
             Buddhism impacted Japanese culture to a large extent, if we go by historical records.
              Japan, popularly known as the land of rising sun or we may say oldest country in the 
              world by age, has seen many empires rising and simultaneously, falling.
               Japan became an influential country only during the Meiji Restoration era.
             This oldest country in Asia is also amongst the oldest countries in the world.</p>
