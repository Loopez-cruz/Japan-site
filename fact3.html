            Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that is based around lightly vinegared short-grain
             rice served with a selection of toppings or fillings like salmon, tuna, tofu, shellfish,
              vegetables, chicken, wasabi, etc. Sashimi typically includes a thinly sliced raw fish or
               meat with an optional serving of rice. With globalization, restaurants serving Japanese
                cuisine have opened in many parts of the world. Sushi and sashimi are now consumed by
                 people of different nationalities with the former being more favored than the latter.
